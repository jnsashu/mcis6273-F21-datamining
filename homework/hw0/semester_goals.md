# Semester Goals for Data Mining

***Listen to all the Classes***

* Listen to all the classes remotely but I would like to have full in-class method.
* Interaction with classmates gives up anothoer advantage in group discussions.

***Data Mining could be steeping stone for AI/ML***

* Need to learn data mining which gives basic understanding how to handle the data sets.
* Using the knowledge in data mining can be appiled to my future programs like AI/ML Artifical Intelligence and Machine learning.

***Apply the concepts on the Real world Data sets***

* Apart from the class assingments need to concentrate on others data sets which are available on Kaggle.
* Get a real world data and want to explore EDA and other techiniques on it.
